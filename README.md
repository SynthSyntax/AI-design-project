The neuro-symbolic architecture we've built combines a YOLO-like
single-stage detection algorithm with knowledge graph integration, semantic
analysis, and fuzzy logic. This architecture aims to enhance the model's
adaptability and performance in various use cases by combining the
strengths of deep learning and symbolic reasoning.
